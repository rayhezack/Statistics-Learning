The repository mainly logs learning experience of statistics. After learning and reading statistics books, I will be proactive summarizing everything I learned so as to digest those knowledge and theories. To more clearly demonstrate some of conceptions or statistical theories, I may explain them using real interview questions that data scientists might encounter in their interviews. 



**In order to pursue a career of data scientists, we need to master the following skills:**

- Statistics
- Machine Learning
- Product Sense
- SQL/Python
- Data Storytelling
- Strong veral and communication skills


**What I would like to share includes the following topics:**

- Confidence Interval
- Hypothesis Testing
- Power Analysis
- A/B Testing
