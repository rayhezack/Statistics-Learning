    "If we conducted multiple hypothesis tests but just report one with the smallest p-value, the multiple comparisons problem is called *p-hacking.* When there are multiple tests, and we choose the lowest p-value, our estimates of the p-value and the effect size are likely to be biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "如果我们开展多次假设性检验但是仅仅报道哪些P值最小的试验结果，这种试验比较被称作p-hacking。在该背景下，试验结果对于p值的估计以及effect size很有可能存在误差。而p-hacking就出现于multiple hypothesis testing的情景下。\n",

    "#### What is Multiple Hypothesis Testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we compute 100 metrics for our experiment, how many metircs would you see as statistically significant even if our feature does nothing? With the significance level at 5%, the anwer is around five. The problem worsens when examing hundreds of experiments and multiple iterations per experiment. When testing multiple things in parallel, the number of false discoveries increases. **This is called the \"multiple testing\" problem.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we need to look at two types of errors when conducting multiple hypothesis testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Type I error** refers to that we reject the null hypothesis when there is actually no effect.\n",
    "- **Type II error** refers to that we fail to reject the null hypothesis when there is actual effect.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Looking at multiple metrics.\n",
    "- Looking at p-values across time.\n",
    "- Looking at segments of the population.\n",
    "- Looking at multiple iterations of an experiment.\n",
    "  - For example, if an experiment truly does nothing, running it 20 time may result in a p-value smaller than 0.05 by chance."
